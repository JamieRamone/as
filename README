This is a UNIX command line administrative tool to run a command another user. This command may only be run by the ssystem
administrator i.e. the user with UID 0. It is built using GNU make, issuing make on the command line (whilst in this directory), and
installs to /etc. To perform the installation, you issue make install on the command line.

It takes two arguments: the account name of the desired user you'ld like to run a command as, and the command itself. If only the
user is given it'll complain and abort. It's also positional: the first argument is the user, the second one is the command, period.
They can't be supplied via position independent modifiers (e.g. -u user -c command <-> -c command -u user). It'll also fail if the
given account name can't be found in the /etc/passwd. It'll also accept the single '-?', '-h', or '--help' argument, which causes it
to print a help message about how to use it.
